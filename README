The Driver file that contains the main method is Triangle.java.

This is a Program that takes an input of 2 arguments.
The output of the program will be pretty printed into a triangle shape
with the min value as the top of the triangle anf the max at the bottom.

To compile the file:
    "javac Triangle.java"

To run the program:
    "java Triangle (num1) (num2)"

For example:
    Example 1:
        input: java Triangle 1 4
        output:
                        1
                    1   2   1
                1   2   3   2   1
            1   2   3   4   3   2   1

    Example 2:
        input: java Triangle 5 10
        output:
                                5
                            5   6   5
                        5   6   7   6   5
                    5   6   7   8   7   6   5
                5   6   7   8   9   8   7   6   5
            5   6   7   8   9   10  9   8   7   6   5


Further Questions to be asked would be:
    What should I do if the input is 0 whether it be as a num1 or num2?
        Answer: There is a possibility of 0 values for num1 and num2.
    
    I am assuming the numbers passed must satisfy [num1 < num2], 
    if not how should I handle scenarios with [num1 = num2] or [num1 > num2]
        Answer: If they are equal to each other then print out only one row.
                If num1 > num2 then account for which on is min and max and assign values
    
    Are there negative numbers?
        Answer: No, the domain is strictly [0, infinite)
